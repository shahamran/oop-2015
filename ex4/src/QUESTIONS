#Week 6 Questions
#============

#Map<A,Integer> myMap = new HashMap<>();
#class A { }
#class B extends A { }
#Select all lines that will pass compilation
#1: myMap.put(new A(), new Integer(6));
#2: myMap.put(new B(), new Integer(6));
#3: myMap.put(new B(), 6);
#4: myMap.put(new Object(), new Integer(6));

w6Answer1 = (0,0)
# The answer should be a python-tuple of the chosen numbers, i.e. (1,7,3,8) or (2,6,1)
# optional explanation.

#public class Number implements Comparable<Number> {}
#ComplexNumber num1 = new ComplexNumber(5,2);
#ComplexNumber num2 = new ComplexNumber(4,3);
#int compareResult = num1.compareTo(num2);
#What are the declarations of the ComplexNumber class for which the above code will compile? (multiple choice)
#1: public class ComplexNumber implements Comparator<ComplexNumber> {}
#2: public class ComplexNumber implements Comparable<ComplexNumber> {}
#3: public class ComplexNumber extends Number<ComplexNumber> {}
#4: public class ComplexNumber extends Number {}

w6Answer2 = (0,0)
# The answer should be a python-tuple of the chosen numbers, i.e. (1,7,3,8) or (2,6,1)
# optional explanation.

#Choose all correct statements:
#1: A class can have only a single Comparator.
#2: The implementation of compareTo(A a) should be consistent with that of equals() in the class A.
#3: Comparators have access to private data members.
#4: Only the implementation of the Comparable<A> can be used to determine the order of elements in a TreeSet<A>.
#5: A Comparator<A> can be used to order objects of the type A, and of types extending A.
#6: Comparators allow us to change the comparison methods of some class in runtime.

#public void doAction() {
#	doFoo();
#	doBar();
#}
#
#For every checked exception thrown by the methods doFoo() and doBar(), the above method doAction() 
# must either catch it or explicitly declare it as thrown.
#1: Correct
#2: Incorrect

# class ExceptionA extends Exception {}
# class ExceptionB extends ExceptionA {}
# class ExceptionC extends ExceptionA {}
#Which of the following catch clauses will NOT catch an exception of type ExceptionB? (single choice)
#1: catch (Exception e) {...
#2: catch (ExceptionA e) {...
#3: catch (ExceptionB | ExceptionC e) {...
#4: catch (ExceptionC e) {...

w7Answer2 = 0
# optional explanation.

#Which of the following is true? (single choice)
#1: An exception cannot include any data members.
#2: Unchecked exceptions cannot be caught by a try-catch clause.
#3: Unchecked exceptions cannot be thrown by the throw key-word.
#4: Methods can declare that they throw unchecked exceptions.

w7Answer3 = 0
# optional explanation.

#Which of the following is NOT true? (single choice)
#1: Packages can be used to group together related classes.
#2: Packages have no effect over access permission between different classes.
#3: A class doesn't have to extend class A to access its protected members.
#4: Packages can be used to solve conflicting class names.
