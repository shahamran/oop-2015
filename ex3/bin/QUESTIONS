#Week 4 Questions
#============

#Choose the correct statement:
#1: interfaces are a special case of abstract classes
#2: interfaces can implement non-abstract (instantiable) classes
#3: interfaces can extend other interfaces
#4: interfaces can only include abstract methods as members

w4Answer1 = 3
# optional explanation.

#Choose the correct statement:
#1: abstract classes are immutable
#2: abstract classes may only contain public members
#3: ANY class that extends an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods
#4: an abstract class may contain a constructor

w4Answer2 = 4
# optional explanation.

#Choose all correct statements:
#1: An interface can have no private members
#2: An interface is non-instantiable but can include partial implementation
#3: An abstract class may not implement interfaces
#4: There may be a reference whose type is an abstract class
#5: There may not be a reference whose type is an interface
#6: A class may extend any number of abstract classes
#7: Protected data members can be declared as abstract
#8: Every class with abstract methods must be abstract

w4Answer3 = (1,4)
# The answer should be a python-tuple of the chosen numbers, i.e. (1,7,3,8) or (2,6,1)
# optional explanation.
#6 Not explicitly - a class can extend an abstract class which extends an abstract class.
#  In this way (implicitly) it can extend any number of classes, but CANNOT use: extends c1,c2,c3...
#8 An interface can also have abstract methods though it is not considered abstract class - but an interface
#  Also, the methods in the interface are considered abstract because they can have no implementation,
#	even though they don't have the 'abstract' keyword before them.
